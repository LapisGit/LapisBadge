# June 27th: Started and finished designing the PCB and case!

Today I was scrolling through the Highway site, just as I submitted my HackPad, and I saw the "Hack Badge" idea listed, and I wondered, "what the hell is a hack badge??" so I found the images provided, and holy crap they look cool. So I decided, if I'm actually going to be going to Undercity, why not go in *style!!*

So today I started and finished work on the PCB and case, I'm going to be soon starting on working on the firmware (even though it's going to be hard without the actual stuff here for me, but oh well! It'll just be a mockup before my project gets approved *hopefully...*)

Here's some images!

# June 27th Part 2!!!!!!: Firmware

I'm going to be honest, this 100% WILL NOT work right out of the box lol, the project isn't approved, and even if it was, I wouldn't have the parts right now, so expect ALOT of changes to the firmware eventually.
